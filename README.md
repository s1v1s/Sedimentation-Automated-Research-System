## Research structure
Processing the initial data using a computer vision (CV) algorithm involves:

● Identifying significant image regions; 

● Tuning algorithm parameters;

● Scaling images considering camera specifics.


Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) involves: 

● Recognising boundary level between mediums; 

● Creating diagrams for level changes in different containers.


## Results
● Algorithm for defining medium boundaries using computer vision methods

● Neural network trained to recognize medium boundaries

● Created a prototype setup and research software
